# SpaceBangTheGame
A fun engaging game written in 8086 assembly as a project for the "Microprocessor Systems - 1" course in Cairo University - Faculty of Engineering. In this repo you'll find the source code for the game; for playing the game you'll need to compile the .asm file and run the executable on dosbox.
